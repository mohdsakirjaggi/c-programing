// Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.
